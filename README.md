# Employee-Management-System
An application which stores the data of employees of a particular company with register and login page.
The application uses Python as a programming language with sql as a database to store any data.
For example - I have installed XAMP Control Panel for storing. If you are using those code for register and login page and management system. Create a database in Xamp Control Panel or any other platform which can do it perfectly.
Also name the file as per the given code like stm, employee3 etc.
I have done this code in VSCode. You can use any platform.
Also install some necessary packages and libraries of python like tkinter, pymysql, etc. You can install it via cmd.
Then first run the register page, enter your details it will open login page, login the page and the management system appears. You can create the datas of employee, delete the datas, update the datas and much more.

# Basic requirements :
1. VSCode or any other comfortable coding platform.
2. XAMP Control Panel for database operation, you can prefer similar working other softwares also.
3. Python setup in your laptop or desktop.
